Feature: Configure auto capture sessions

Scenario: An error report and session report is sent when auto capture sessions is on using the net http framework
  Given I set environment variable "API_KEY" to "a35a2a72bd230ac0aa0f52715bbdc6aa"
  And I configure the bugsnag endpoints
  And I set environment variable "AUTO_CAPTURE_SESSIONS" to "true"
  When I run the http-net test server with the "auto capture sessions" configuration
  And I wait for 1 second
  Then I should receive 2 requests
  And the request used payload v4 headers
  And the request contained the api key "a35a2a72bd230ac0aa0f52715bbdc6aa"
  And the event "session" is not null
  And the payload field "events.0.session.events.handled" equals 1 for request 0
  And the payload field "sessionCounts.0.sessionsStarted" equals 1 for request 1
