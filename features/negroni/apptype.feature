Feature: Configuring app type

Scenario: A negroni error report contains the configured app type
  Given I set environment variable "API_KEY" to "a35a2a72bd230ac0aa0f52715bbdc6aa"
  And I am working with a new negroni app
  And I configure the bugsnag notify endpoint only
  And I set environment variable "APP_TYPE" to "background-queue"
  When I run the script "features/fixtures/negroni/run.sh"
  And I go to the negroni route "/handled"
  Then I should receive a request
  And the request used payload v4 headers
  And the request contained the api key "a35a2a72bd230ac0aa0f52715bbdc6aa"
  And the event "app.type" equals "background-queue"
