Feature: Sending meta data

Scenario: Revel integration can add metadata
  And I work with a new 'revel-0.20.0' app
  And I set the "revel-0.20.0" config variable "bugsnag.apikey" to "a35a2a72bd230ac0aa0f52715bbdc6aa"
  And I configure the bugsnag endpoint in the config file for 'revel-0.20.0'
  When I run the script "features/fixtures/revel-0.20.0/run.sh"
  And I wait for 4 seconds
  And I go to the route "/metadata"
  And I wait for 1 seconds
  Then I should receive a request
  And the event "metaData.Account.Price(dollars)" equals "1 Million"

Scenario: An error report contains custom meta data when using the net http framework
  Given I set environment variable "API_KEY" to "a35a2a72bd230ac0aa0f52715bbdc6aa"
  And I configure the bugsnag endpoints
  When I run the http-net test server with the "meta data" configuration
  And I wait for 1 second
  Then I should receive 2 requests
  And the request used payload v4 headers
  And the request contained the api key "a35a2a72bd230ac0aa0f52715bbdc6aa"
  And the event "metaData.Scheme.Customer.Name" equals "Joe Bloggs"
  And the event "metaData.Scheme.Customer.Age" equals "21"
  And the event "metaData.Scheme.Level" equals "Blue"
