Feature: Capturing request information automatically

Background:
  Given I set environment variable "API_KEY" to "a35a2a72bd230ac0aa0f52715bbdc6aa"
  And I configure the bugsnag endpoint
  And I set environment variable "SERVER_PORT" to "4512"
  And I have built the service "nethttp"

Scenario: An error report will automatically contain request information
  Given I set environment variable "AUTO_CAPTURE_SESSIONS" to "false"
  When I start the service "nethttp"
  And I wait for the app to open port "4512"
  And I wait for 2 seconds
  And I open the URL "http://localhost:4512/handled"
  Then I wait to receive a request
  And the request is a valid error report with api key "a35a2a72bd230ac0aa0f52715bbdc6aa"
  And the event "request.clientIp" is not null
  And the event "request.headers.User-Agent" equals "Ruby"
  And the event "request.httpMethod" equals "GET"
  And the event "request.url" ends with "/handled"
  And the event "request.url" starts with "http://"
