Feature: Configuring on before notify

Scenario: Send three bugsnags and use on before notify to drop one and modify the message of another
  Given I set environment variable "API_KEY" to "a35a2a72bd230ac0aa0f52715bbdc6aa"
  And I configure the bugsnag endpoints
  When I configure with the "on before notify" configuration and send an error
  And I wait for 1 second
  Then I should receive 2 requests
  And the "bugsnag-api-key" header equals "a35a2a72bd230ac0aa0f52715bbdc6aa" for request 0 
  And the "bugsnag-api-key" header equals "a35a2a72bd230ac0aa0f52715bbdc6aa" for request 1
  And the payload field "events.0.exceptions.0.message" equals "Don't ignore this error" for request 0
  And the payload field "events.0.exceptions.0.message" equals "Error message was changed" for request 1
